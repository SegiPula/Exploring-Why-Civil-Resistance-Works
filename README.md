# Exploring-Why-Civil-Resistance-Works

This project focuses on exploring the effectiveness of nonviolent versus violent resistance campaigns, replicating findings from Erica Chenoweth and Maria J. Stephan's research in their book Why Civil Resistance Works. Using datasets such as the Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes (NAVCO) Dataset and the Polity Project

## Steps
* Frequency of violent and non-violent campaigns
* Success Rate of non-violent campaigns
* Success Rate per non-violent & violent campaigns per decade.
* Largest Resistance Campaigns
* Regression Models for analysing the relationships between Participants and the probability of Success.
* Success Rate per Participation using Probabilities.
* Minimum Participation for probability of 99% success rate.
* Creating Predicting Models for Success Rate based on Population, Participation and Regime Type.
